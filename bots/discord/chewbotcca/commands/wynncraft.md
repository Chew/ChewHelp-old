# `/wynncraft` Command

The `/wynncraft` command allows users to find Wynncraft stats for players or guilds.

## Usage

Type `/wynncraft` to start getting suggestions. Type in the name of the guild or player you want to look up. Discord will auto-complete suggestions for you. Pick the player or guild, then press send.

For players, you will view basic stats until you click the "View Character" button. From there, you will get a drop down list of characters/classes to view more info for. Once one is selected, 3 new buttons will show up to switch between general stats, profession stats, and dungeon stats for that character. Every page has a refresh button.

For guilds, only a single page of basic information is shown. A button to view guild members is provided, but will only ephemerally reply.

## Arguments

| Name | Type | Kind | Description |
|------|------|------|-------------|
| `query` | `String` | Required | The player or guild to get.

## Permissions

No special permissions are required for users or bots, but server owners may modify command priviledges per Discord's own settings.
