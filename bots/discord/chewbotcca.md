# Chewbotcca for Discord

> This site has documentation for the bot and its commands. To learn about his history, see the [page on ChewWiki](https://chew.wiki/view/Chewbotcca_Discord_Bot).

Chewbotcca for Discord is back and better than ever! 
It is completely re-written in Java using the JDA Discord API library.

It aims to be exactly what the [Legacy Discord bot was](https://github.com/Chewbotcca/Discord-Legacy), and hopefully even better!

I hope you enjoy the bot and want to improve it :)

## What is it?

Chewbotcca is my multi-purpose bot for Discord, mostly with commands that I would like to use.

The goal of Chewbotcca isn't really to be the "best", its goal is to have features that I personally want in a Discord bot, and if you agree, you're free to add the bot yourself.

## What can it do?

It's mostly fun commands like [`/roll`](/bots/discord/chewbotcca/commands/roll)ing some dice, getting cats with [`/cat`](/bots/discord/chewbotcca/commands/cat), and more.

However, it can also be used to find information like getting RubyGem information with [`/rubygem`](/bots/discord/commands/rubygem), ironic considering this is a Java bot now.

It also has powerful server info commands,
for example, you can run [`/serverinfo bots`](/bots/discord/chewbotcca/commands/serverinfo#bots-sub-command) to find all bots on the server, and when they got added,
being able to find role and member counts ([`/serverinfo roles`](/bots/discord/chewbotcca/commands/serverinfo#roles-sub-command)),
finding a member by join position ([`/serverinfo member [position]`](/bots/discord/chewbotcca/commands/serverinfo#member-sub-command)),
finding boosters and boost time ([`/serverinfo boosts`](/bots/discord/chewbotcca/commands/serverinfo#boosts-sub-command)),
and more!

There's also commands such as [`/youtube`](/bots/discord/chewbotcca/commands/youtube) to find YouTube videos,
and [`/github user`](/bots/discord/chewbotcca/commands/github) to detail your favorite developers on GitHub.

I'm always open to suggestions on what to add. Please let me know what you would like to see!
