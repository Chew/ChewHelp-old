# MLB-GameFeed-Bot

Add to your server with [this link](https://canary.discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=987144502374436895&permissions=1067024&scope=bot%20applications.commands)!

View the bot on Discord's [app directory](https://discord.com/application-directory/987144502374436895)!

This bot allows you to view the live play-by-plays for any MLB.com game. This attempts to mimic [gameday](https://mlb.com/gameday)

To get started, add the bot to your server. Next, wait for a game to be active, finally, type `/startgame` to see active Major League games.

## How it Works

You can learn about watching a game feed [here](/bots/discord/mlb-game-feed/watching-a-game-feed). You can see hits, game advisories, and more.

## Commands

You can view the commands for the bot [on the commands page](/bots/discord/mlb-game-feed/commands).

Running `/startgame` does not memorize the game, you will have to start it every time a game starts!
