# /startgame Command

This command starts an actively playing game.

To see how running a game looks and works, see [watching a game feed](/bots/discord/mlb-game-feed/watching-a-game-feed).

## Usage

The command will autocomplete active Major League games when executed. Simply select an option then send to start the game.

To start a future game, see [`/plangame`](/bots/discord/mlb-game-feed/commands/plangame).
